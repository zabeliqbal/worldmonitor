# Map Engine

3D globe and flat map rendering, textures, shaders, clustering, and mobile touch gestures in World Monitor.

### Dual Map Engine — 3D Globe + Flat Map

Two rendering engines are available, switchable at runtime via Settings or the `VITE_MAP_INTERACTION_MODE` environment variable (`globe` or `flat`). The preference is persisted in localStorage.

**3D Globe (globe.gl + Three.js)** — a photorealistic 3D Earth with full pitch and rotation:

- **Earth textures** — topographic-bathymetric day surface (`earth-topo-bathy.jpg`), specular water map for ocean reflections, and a starfield night-sky background
- **Atmosphere shader** — a Fresnel limb-glow effect simulates atmospheric scattering at the globe's edge
- **Auto-rotation** — the globe slowly rotates when idle, pausing on any user interaction and resuming after 60 seconds of inactivity
- **HTML marker layer** — all 28+ data categories (conflicts, intel hotspots, AIS vessels, flights, protests, fires, etc.) render as HTML elements pinned to geographic coordinates on the globe surface
- **Geopolitical polygon overlays** — the Korean DMZ and other boundary polygons render directly on the globe under the conflicts layer
- **Debounced marker flush** — rapid data updates are coalesced via `debounceFlushMarkers()` to prevent Three.js scene graph crashes during high-frequency data refresh
- **Configurable render quality** — a Settings dropdown offers five pixel-ratio presets: Auto (matches device DPR, capped at 2×), Eco (1×), Sharp (1.5×), 4K (2×), and Insane (3×). The setting updates the Three.js renderer live without page reload. Desktop (Tauri) builds cap the default at 1.25× to avoid software-rendering fallback on machines without discrete GPUs
- **Desktop-optimized defaults** — Tauri desktop builds request the high-performance GPU (`powerPreference: 'high-performance'`), disable the logarithmic depth buffer (saves shader overhead), and turn off auto-rotation and camera damping to eliminate continuous render loop wakeups when idle — addressing reports of 1 fps performance on some machines
- **Background pause** — when the desktop app window loses focus or the globe panel is hidden, the WebGL render loop pauses entirely, stopping the Three.js animation loop and canceling auto-rotate. Data updates received while paused are queued and flushed in a single batch when the globe returns to view, eliminating background GPU load on laptops
- **Beta indicator** — a pulsing cyan "BETA" badge appears when the globe is active, signaling the feature is newer than the flat map

**Flat Map (deck.gl + MapLibre GL JS)** — a WebGL-accelerated 2D map with smooth 60fps rendering and thousands of concurrent markers:

- **Layer types** — `GeoJsonLayer`, `ScatterplotLayer`, `PathLayer`, `IconLayer`, `TextLayer`, `PolygonLayer`, `ArcLayer`, `HeatmapLayer` composited in a single render pass
- **Smart clustering** — Supercluster groups markers at low zoom, expands on zoom in. Cluster thresholds adapt to zoom level
- **Progressive disclosure** — detail layers (bases, nuclear, datacenters) appear only when zoomed in; zoom-adaptive opacity fades markers from 0.2 at world view to 1.0 at street level
- **Label deconfliction** — overlapping labels (e.g., multiple BREAKING badges) are automatically suppressed by priority, highest-severity first
- **Day/night overlay** — a terminator line divides the map into sunlit and dark hemispheres based on the current UTC time

**Shared across both engines:**

- **45 data layers** — conflicts, military bases, nuclear facilities, undersea cables, pipelines, satellite fire detection, protests, natural disasters, datacenters, displacement flows, climate anomalies, cyber threat IOCs, GPS/GNSS jamming zones, Iran attacks, CII country risk heatmap, day/night terminator, geopolitical boundaries (Korean DMZ), stock exchanges, financial centers, central banks, commodity hubs, Gulf investments, trade routes, airport delays, sanctions regimes, and more. All layer definitions are maintained in a single shared catalog (`map-layer-definitions.ts`) consumed by both renderers — adding a new layer is a single-file operation. Layers are variant-specific: full (29 geopolitical + military + infrastructure), tech (12 startup/cloud/cyber), finance (15 exchange/banking/trade), and happy (5 positive-events/conservation)
- **8 regional presets** — Global, Americas, Europe, MENA, Asia, Africa, Oceania, Latin America
- **Time filtering** — 1h, 6h, 24h, 48h, 7d event windows
- **URL state sharing** — map center, zoom, active layers, and time range are encoded in the URL for shareable views (`?view=mena&zoom=4&layers=conflicts,bases`)
- **Mobile touch gestures** — single-finger pan with inertial velocity animation (0.92 decay factor, computed from 4-entry circular touch history), two-finger pinch-to-zoom with center-point preservation, and bottom-sheet popups with drag-to-dismiss. An 8px movement threshold prevents accidental interaction during taps
- **Timezone-based region detection** — on first load, the map centers on the user's approximate region derived from `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` — no network dependency, no geolocation prompt. On mobile, the browser's Geolocation API is queried (5-second timeout) and the map auto-centers on the user's precise GPS coordinates at zoom level 6. If the URL already contains shared coordinates, the shared view takes precedence and geolocation is skipped
- **Cmd+K map navigation** — the command palette supports `Map:` prefixed commands to fly to any country or region on either engine
